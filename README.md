# 3DS Latin
It bothers me that the 3DS lacks a Latin option but Minecraft has a Latin option, so I'm fixing that here

I will start with the HOMEmenu then move on to other system applets and apps

## HOMEmenu
10% complete (59/589)

### How to install
1. Extract your HOMEmenu following the instructions in the [HOMEmenu editing](https://axities.github.io/) page

2. Copy `menu_msbt.LZ` from this repo into `~/message/EU_{Your language choice}/` then rebuild

3. BE SURE TO ENCRYPT IT FIRST

4. Download [EixMode9 v.1.4.4.8-1-E](https://github.com/eiiiiix/EixMode9/releases) and boot the .firm file in whatever way suits you

5. Find the ecrypted .cia on you SD Card and mount it

6. Select the .app file and inject it to your home menu using the homemenu inject option

7. Reboot into the modded NAND and enjoy a HOMEmenu thats in a language you likely can't read

8. If it doesnt boot you can restore the HOMEmenu by entering the `HOME more...` menu in EixMode9 and choosing restore homemenu

If you brick, please DM me on discord `Gemo#2004` or create an issue here and tell me EXACTLY what you did with asmuch detail as possible so I can fix it or tell you what you did wrong



Enjoy not being able to read your HOMEmenu! ~Eix
