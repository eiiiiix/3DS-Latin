# 3DS Latin
It bothers me that the 3DS lacks a Latin option but Minecraft has a Latin option, so I'm fixing that here

I will start with the HOMEmenu then move on to other system applets and apps

## HOMEmenu
10% complete (59/589)

### How to install
Extract your HOMEmenu following the instructions in the [HOMEmenu editing](https://axities.github.io/) page
Copy `menu_msbt.LZ` from this repo into `EU_{Your language choice}` then rebuild
BE SURE TO ENCRYPT IT FIRST
Download [EixMode9 v.1.4.4.8-1-E](https://github.com/eiiiiix/EixMode9/releases) and boot the .firm file in whatever way suits you
Find the ecrypted .cia on you SD Card and mount it
Select the .app file and inject it to your home menu using the homemenu inject option
Reboot into the modded NAND and enjoy a HOMEmenu thats in a language you likely can't read
If it doesnt boot you can restore the HOMEmenu by entering the `HOME more...` menu in EixMode9 and choosing restore homemenu

If you brick, please DM me on discord `Gemo#2004` or create an issue here and tell me EXACTLY what you did with asmuch detail as possible so I can fix it or tell you what you did wrong



Enjoy not being able to read your HOMEmenu! ~Eix
